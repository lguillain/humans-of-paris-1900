   ### Run application locally
   
   You need: 
   - [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) >= 4.7.12
   - [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/) >= 3.6.6
   - [Docker command line](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/) >= 18.09.2
   
   then run: 
   ```bash
   conda --version
   python --version
   docker --version
   make install
   git clone https://github.com/liabifano/openface.git
   make docker-build-openface # this might take a while but it's just once
   make docker-run-openface # for doppelganger feature
   make bootstrap-db # run just once is enough
   make run
   ```
   We can also skip openface clone and build and bootstrap-db if you did it once already. If you would like to expose
   the application endpoint you can run `make expose` after `make run`. 
   

If the openface docker is still up, you can run 
```bash
docker ps | grep openface | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker rm -f
```
   

If you want to use the environment with jupyter notebook run:
 ```bash
 make install
 conda install ipykernel # or pip install ipykernel
 python -m ipykernel install --user --name humans-of-paris --display-name "Humans of Paris"
 ```
 and then select Humans of Paris on the top of your notebook.
 
 You can also find a detailed description of each notebook [here](https://github.com/liabifano/humans-of-paris-1900/blob/master/notebooks/README.md)
